# Namenskonventionen

## Kebab Case

In this format, words are separated with hyphens, for example, "my-variable-name". This format is often used in CSS files.

## Pascal Case

Similar to Camel Case, but the first letter of each word is capitalized, e.g. "MyVariableName". This format is often used in object-oriented programming and C#.

## Screaming Snake Case

This is a variant of the Snake Case where all letters are capitalized and words are separated by underscores, e.g. "MY_VARIABLEN_NAME". This format is often used to indicate constants.

## Train Case

Similar to Kebab Case, but with capital letters, e.g. "MY-VARIABLEN-NAME". This format is used in some languages like Ruby and Lisp.

## Hungarian Notation

In this format, the variable name is prefixed with a prefix that indicates the type of variable. For example, a variable containing a string can be prefixed with "str", e.g. "strName".

## Upper Camel Case oder StudlyCase

This is similar to Pascal Case, but the first letter of the first word is also capitalized. This format is sometimes called "StudlyCase" because it is reminiscent of the capitalization of study or key words, e.g. "MyTollerVariableName".

## Lower Camel Case oder dromedar case

Also known as "dromedar case", similar to Camel Case, but the first letter of the first word is written in lower case, e.g. "myTollerVariablenName". This format is often used in Java and JavaScript.

## Mixed Case

This format contains both upper and lower case letters in a random way, e.g. "MeInVaRiAbLeNaMe". It is not recommended because it can affect the readability of the code.

## Abbreviations

Some developers use abbreviations for variable names to make them shorter, e.g. "i" for "index" or "num" for "number". It is important to ensure that the abbreviations are clear to everyone on the team to avoid misunderstandings.
