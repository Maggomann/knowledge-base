## Pull Request Splitting | Pull Request Partitioning

In software development, the technical term "pull request splitting" or "pull request partitioning" is used to divide a pull request into several smaller pull requests.

The process of pull request splitting is a method to simplify code review and integration of changes into a code base. For complex or large changes, it can be difficult to review and integrate a large pull request. Splitting the pull request into smaller units makes it easier to review and integrate changes into the code base.

An example of pull request splitting might be when a developer wants to integrate a new feature into an existing application. Instead of bundling all the changes into one large pull request, the developer could split the pull request into several smaller units, such as one unit for the new database table, one unit for the back-end logic, and one unit for the front-end integration. This way, reviewers can more easily track the changes and provide more targeted feedback.

Pull request splitting, then, is a method of breaking down large and complex changes into smaller and more easily understood units to facilitate code review and integration of changes.
