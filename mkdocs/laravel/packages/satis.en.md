"Satis" is an open source software for PHP developers used for managing dependencies and building packages. With Satis, developers can create and manage a private repository for their PHP packages instead of publishing them to public repositories like Packagist.

Satis allows developers to manage their dependencies in a single repository and use that repository for internal purposes. This is especially useful for companies or organizations that have their own PHP packages and want to manage them internally.

Satis uses Composer technology to create packages and manage dependencies. It also allows developers to add custom repositories and publish their packages to other repositories if desired.
