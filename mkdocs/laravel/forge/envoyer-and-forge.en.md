## Envoyer

Envoyer is a deployment tool specifically designed for deploying applications on servers. It can provide seamless integration with Forge, a managed server hosting service that allows users to create and configure server instances and then host their applications on those servers. Envoyer offers a user interface that enables users to deploy and manage their applications on their servers.

## Forge

Forge, in turn, provides the necessary resources to host and configure the server instances on which the application runs. Forge also uses recipes (provisioning scripts) to configure the servers before the application is deployed. These recipes can be used to define PHP versions, database configurations, web server configurations, and more. Envoyer utilizes these recipes to ensure that the server instances on which the application is deployed are properly configured.

## Envoyer and Forge

In summary, Envoyer plays an important role in deploying and managing applications on the servers provided by Forge. It uses Forge's configurations and recipes to ensure that the server instances are correctly configured and that the applications run smoothly on these instances.
